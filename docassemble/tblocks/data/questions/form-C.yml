  Form C 
  Required Disclosures
subquestion: |
  A Company that wants to raise money using Regulation Crowdfunding must give certain information to prospective Investors, so Investors will have a basis for making an informed decision. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, has issued regulations at 17 CFR §227.201 listing the information companies must provide. This form – Form C – is the form used to provide that information.
  
  You will be asked questions that correspond to sections of the SEC’s regulations. In some cases, we’ve provided instructions for the Company completing this form. 

  Do you have the information about your company and finances ready?
